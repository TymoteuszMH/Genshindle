Green fields means that character you selected and the hero shares this value and red means they don't. If you guess right, you win and you can play again.

##General Info
  My college came with an idea, that it would be cool if there was some better genshindle. He created his own, but it was poorly written in js + php, so, out of bordom, I decided to do one as well, but using Angular. It came up pretty well, I belive.
